Welcome to Dr. Evil's little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day! Mua ha ha ha!
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
That's number 2. Keep going!
Halfway there!
So you got that one.  Try this one.
Good work!  On to the next...
Curses, you've found the secret phase!
But finding it and solving it are quite different...
Bravo! You've defused the secret stage!
	Dr. Evil finally knew that the students at PKU are not easy to defeat.
	He fled in haste, but you know it is not over...
	"A sleepless malice", uttered you as you caught a whiff of the next trouble...
Congratulations! You've defused the bomb!
Your instructor has been notified and will verify your solution.
